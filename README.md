# Discount Calculator

This project demonstrates the use of **functions** and **control flow** in Python.

## Description
The program defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
- Applies a discount if it is **20% or higher**.
- Returns the original price if the discount is **less than 20%**.

The program prompts the user to:
1. Enter the original price of an item.
2. Enter the discount percentage.
3. It then prints the final price after applying the discount, or the original price if no discount is applied.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python discount_calculator.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Example
```
Enter the original price of the item: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after 25.0% discount: 750.0
```
